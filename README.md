## Read this before self-hosting!
1Bot has a **weather command**, which uses [OpenWeatherMap's API](https://openweathermap.org/api). You will need to create an account and put your API key in the `.env` file and call it `OWM_KEY`.  
You will also need to create a [Tenor Developer account](https://tenor.com/developer/keyregistration) and store your API key in the `.env` file and name it `TENORKEY`.

Since the bot has a warn command, you also need a [MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com) (need help with the database setup? Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE_bJl2GAY8)).
